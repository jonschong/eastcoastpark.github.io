		<p>
			Fishing is one of the many ways of spending an afternoon by the beach or in the park.
			Did you know that one of Singapore most beloved parks also houses a popular fishing location?
			East Coast park offers both shallow and deep water fishing to capture a variety of fishes.
			Here are some popular fishing spots!

			You can go for the challenge of shallow water fishing just off the coast,
			or head further away to the deeper ends for more intense angling.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Changi Beach</b>
